# bee_merging_simulation
This repository represents the work I performed in my Junior Independent Research Project at Princeton University.

This repository contains the scripts of a Unity project that are used to create a simulation of bees merging two honeycombs.  Simulation.zip contians the actual simulation.  To use this simulation, download the zip file and unzip it to a folder of your choice.  Then run "Bee Comb Merging Simulation (1).exe".
